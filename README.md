# CIFAR-10_practice
Build a CNN to classify 10 different types of objects in the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.
- First time working with keras/tensorflow
- The [dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

- misc: At first, I followed the above links closely as it was my first deep dive into a deep learning project. I tried out the base models provided in those links, learning a lot about optimizing the kernels (weights), and also familiarizing with the keras and tensorflow libraries. Once I felt comfortable enough with the library and base models provided in the links, I tried builing one of my own, which is the one in this repo.
