# CIFAR-10_practice
Build a CNN to classify 10 different types of objects in the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.
- First time working with keras/tensorflow
- The [dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- Helpful resources: Project specific: [1](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-cnn-from-scratch-for-cifar-10-photo-classification/),

- misc: At first, I followed the above links closely as this was my first deep dive into a deep learning project. I tried out the base models provided in those links, learning a lot about kernel constraints, and the types of distributions used to initialize the kernels (weights), as well as the keras and tensorflow libraries! Once I felt comfortable enough with the library and base models provided in the links, I tried builing one of my own, which is the one in this repo.
