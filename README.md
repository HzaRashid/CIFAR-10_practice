# CIFAR-10_practice
Build a CNN to classify 10 different types of objects in the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.
- First time working with keras/tensorflow
- The [dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- Helpful resources: [link1](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-cnn-from-scratch-for-cifar-10-photo-classification/), [link2](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-cnn-from-scratch-for-cifar-10-photo-classification/)
- Misc: So far, I have only built a base model. I still have lots to learn in statistics! I'm not too familiar with distribution, which were vital to initializing the kernels (weights). So I ended up using normal distribution to initialize the kernel, not for any technical reason (i.e. desired results), but just because this is all still new to me!
