# CIFAR-10_practice
This is an Image Classification practice project using the popular [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). It contains 60,000 images (32x32, rgb) divided into 10 classes (categories) based on the object contained in them.

The goal is to build a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53) to identify the 10 classes of images. 


- This was my first time using a deep learning library (Keras with TensorFlow). So most of the time spent on this project went to optimizing the models and learning the libraries.

- Important to note: there are a lot of models that have been applied to this dataset - many of them can be found [here](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-10)
- For the purpose of learning the Keras library, I tried making a few models from stratch using common techniques involved in buidling models for image classification. The models I made can be found in [cifar10_models.py](https://github.com/HzaRashid/CIFAR-10_practice/blob/main/cifar10_models.py)

#### The performance of each model is shown in [test_c10models.ipynb](https://github.com/HzaRashid/CIFAR-10_practice/blob/main/test_c10models.ipynb)
